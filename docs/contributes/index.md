# Contributes

Welcome to our section of Contributes. If you are here, maybe you enjoyed Geomosaic and you would like to have a package/module of your interest integrated in the tool. You are in the right place (we hope!!). I think that through this guide you will be able to integrate what you want without breaking anything!.

Let's jump it in.

Currently, we only accepts packages that can be installed through **some channel of conda** like [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) or [Conda-Forge](https://conda-forge.org/packages/). We do not accept any package that for example can be installed by compiling the source code or package described through Dockerfile or (any type of containerization).
Is not because we don't want, but because we didn't try that ways. However, if you know a way how to do it using conda env, please contact us or open an issue explaining your strategy.
